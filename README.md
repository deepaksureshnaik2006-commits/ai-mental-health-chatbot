AI Mental Health Companion

This project is a simple mental wellness chatbot built using Streamlit and Google Gemini.
The main idea is to provide users with a small space where they can express how they feel, chat freely, and get short supportive responses.

What This App Does

Mood Selection
The home screen shows different mood emojis.
When a user taps on any mood, the app gives a short and friendly response based on the emotion.
It also saves the mood in a CSV file so that the emotions can be tracked over time.

Chat with the AI

Users can type messages and continue the conversation normally.
The chat keeps history during the session, so the conversation feels natural.
The tone of the AI is kept gentle, supportive, and human-like.

Self-Care Tools

The app also includes:

A button for quick positive affirmations

A button for a short guided meditation

These generate small helpful messages whenever needed.
